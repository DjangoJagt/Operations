    "  - `departure_times`: Departure times of flights\n",
    "  - `passenger_numbers`: Number of passengers per flight\n",
    "  - `flight_types`: Type of flight (domestic/international)\n",
    "  - `gate_types`: Type of gate (domestic/international)\n",
    "  - `distances`: Distance matrix between gates\n",

    "- **Decision Variables**:\n",
    "  - `x[i, k]`: Binary variable, 1 if flight \\(i\\) is assigned to gate \\(k\\), 0 otherwise\n",
    "  - `w[i, k, l]`: Continuous variable representing the number of passengers from flight \\(i\\) through gate \\(k\\) to gate \\(l\\)\n",
