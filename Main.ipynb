    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `num_flights`: Number of flights\n",
    "  - `num_gates`: Number of gates\n",
    "  - `arrival_times`: Arrival times of flights\n",
    "  - `departure_times`: Departure times of flights\n",
    "  - `passenger_numbers`: Number of passengers per flight\n",
    "  - `flight_types`: Type of flight (domestic/international)\n",
    "  - `gate_types`: Type of gate (domestic/international)\n",
    "  - `distances`: Distance matrix between gates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Variables**:\n",
    "  - `x[i, k]`: Binary variable, 1 if flight \\(i\\) is assigned to gate \\(k\\), 0 otherwise\n",
    "  - `w[i, k, l]`: Continuous variable representing the number of passengers from flight \\(i\\) through gate \\(k\\) to gate \\(l\\)\n",

    "- **Objective Function**:\n",
    "  - Minimize the total walking distance of passengers.\n",

    "  - Each flight must be assigned to exactly one gate.\n",
    "  - Gates cannot be double-booked.\n",
